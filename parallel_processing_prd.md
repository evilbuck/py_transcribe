# Parallel Processing Framework PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the design for refactoring the current transcription-specific parallel processing code into a generic, reusable parallel processing framework. The framework will be completely discrete from actual processing logic and capable of handling any type of job or process, not just audio transcription.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
The current codebase contains parallel processing logic tightly coupled to audio transcription:
- Direct integration with Whisper models
- Hardcoded audio chunking logic
- Transcription-specific parameters and error handling
- Memory optimization specific to AI model loading

### Pain Points
1. **Tight Coupling**: Processing logic is embedded within transcription code
2. **Limited Reusability**: Cannot be used for other types of parallel processing
3. **Resource Management**: Manual memory and thread management
4. **Scalability Issues**: Fixed thread pool approach doesn't adapt to workload
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error recovery without job retry mechanisms

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Framework Selection: Ray vs Dask vs Custom

After evaluating the requirements, **Dask** is recommended over Ray for the following reasons:

1. **Lightweight**: Lower overhead for CPU-bound tasks
2. **Pure Python**: Better integration with existing codebase
3. **Flexible Scheduling**: Better for heterogeneous workloads
4. **Memory Management**: Superior handling of large data objects
5. **Local Development**: Excellent single-machine performance

### Core Components

#### 1. Job Definition Layer
```python
@dataclass
class Job:
    id: str
    task_type: str
    input_data: Any
    parameters: Dict[str, Any]
    priority: int = 0
    timeout: Optional[int] = None
    retry_count: int = 0
    max_retries: int = 3
```

#### 2. Task Registry
```python
class TaskRegistry:
    """Registry for different types of processing tasks"""
    def register_task(self, task_type: str, handler: Callable)
    def get_handler(self, task_type: str) -> Callable
    def list_task_types(self) -> List[str]
```

#### 3. Resource Manager
```python
class ResourceManager:
    """Manages computational resources across jobs"""
    def estimate_resource_requirements(self, job: Job) -> ResourceEstimate
    def allocate_resources(self, job: Job) -> ResourceAllocation
    def monitor_usage(self) -> ResourceUsage
```

#### 4. Execution Engine
```python
class ParallelExecutionEngine:
    """Core execution engine using Dask"""
    def submit_job(self, job: Job) -> JobHandle
    def submit_batch(self, jobs: List[Job]) -> BatchHandle
    def monitor_progress(self, handle: JobHandle) -> JobStatus
    def cancel_job(self, handle: JobHandle) -> bool
```

## Detailed Design

### Job Lifecycle Management

#### Job States
```python
class JobState(Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    QUEUED = "queued"
    RUNNING = "running"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"
    RETRYING = "retrying"
```

#### State Transitions
- PENDING → QUEUED: Job accepted and queued
- QUEUED → RUNNING: Resources allocated, execution started
- RUNNING → COMPLETED: Job finished successfully
- RUNNING → FAILED: Job failed (within retry limit)
- RUNNING → RETRYING: Job failed (retry attempted)
- ANY → CANCELLED: Job cancelled by user

### Resource Management Strategy

#### Memory Management
```python
class MemoryManager:
    def estimate_memory_usage(self, job: Job) -> int
    def check_memory_availability(self, required: int) -> bool
    def cleanup_completed_jobs(self) -> None
    def get_memory_pressure(self) -> float
```

#### CPU/GPU Allocation
```python
class ComputeManager:
    def detect_available_resources(self) -> ResourceInventory
    def allocate_workers(self, job: Job) -> WorkerAllocation
    def balance_load(self) -> None
    def handle_resource_contention(self) -> None
```

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Input/Output Handling
```python
class DataManager:
    def stage_input_data(self, job: Job) -> StagedData
    def partition_data(self, data: Any, strategy: str) -> List[DataChunk]
    def collect_results(self, partial_results: List[Any]) -> Any
    def cleanup_temporary_data(self, job_id: str) -> None
```

#### Chunking Strategies
- **Time-Based**: For temporal data (audio, video)
- **Size-Based**: For large files or datasets
- **Content-Based**: For structured data
- **Custom**: User-defined chunking logic

### Configuration System

#### Basic Usage
```python
from parallel_framework import ParallelExecutionEngine, Job

# Initialize engine
engine = ParallelExecutionEngine(config_path="config.yaml")

# Register a custom task
@engine.register_task("custom_processing")
def process_data(data, parameters):
    # Your processing logic here
    return processed_data

    id="job_001",
    task_type="custom_processing",
    input_data=my_data,
    parameters={"param1": "value1"}
)

handle = engine.submit_job(job)
result = handle.wait_for_completion()
```

#### Transcription Integration
```python
from parallel_framework import ParallelExecutionEngine
from transcribe.tasks import register_transcription_tasks

# Initialize with transcription tasks
engine = ParallelExecutionEngine()
register_transcription_tasks(engine)

# Submit transcription job
job = Job(
    id="transcribe_001",
    task_type="audio_transcription",
    input_data={"audio_file": "path/to/audio.mp3"},
    parameters={
        "model_size": "base",
        "chunk_size": "10min",
        "device": "auto"
    }
)

handle = engine.submit_job(job)
```

### Performance Targets

#### Scalability
- Support 1-1000 concurrent jobs on single machine
- Linear scaling with available CPU cores
- Memory usage proportional to active job count
- Sub-second job submission latency

#### Reliability
- 99.9% job completion rate for valid jobs
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Graceful degradation under resource pressure
- Complete cleanup of failed/cancelled jobs

#### Monitoring
- Real-time progress tracking
- Resource utilization metrics
- Job completion statistics
- Error rate monitoring

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
The existing transcription API will be preserved through an adapter layer:
```python
# Existing code continues to work
transcriber.transcribe_parallel(
    input_file="audio.mp3",
    output_file="output.txt",
    num_threads=4
)

# New framework automatically handles the job
```

### Gradual Adoption
1. **Phase 1**: Framework runs alongside existing code
2. **Phase 2**: New features use framework exclusively
3. **Phase 3**: Existing code migrated incrementally
4. **Phase 4**: Legacy code removed after validation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Dask Learning Curve**: Medium risk, mitigated by extensive documentation
- **Memory Management**: High risk with large models, addressed by intelligent scheduling
- **Resource Contention**: Medium risk, handled by resource manager
- **Network Dependencies**: Low risk for local execution

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing with various workload patterns
- Fallback to simple thread/process pools if Dask fails
- Resource monitoring with automatic throttling
- Extensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- Framework API coverage: 100% of core functionality
- Test coverage: >90% for framework code
- Documentation completeness: All public APIs documented

### Performance Metrics
- Job throughput: 2x improvement over current implementation
- Resource utilization: >80% CPU utilization during peak load
- Memory efficiency: <10% overhead for framework itself

### Adoption Metrics
- Migration completion: 100% of existing parallel code
- New use cases: At least 2 non-transcription use cases implemented
- Developer satisfaction: Positive feedback from team

## Conclusion

This parallel processing framework will transform the current tightly-coupled transcription code into a flexible, reusable system capable of handling diverse computational workloads. The phased approach ensures minimal disruption while delivering immediate value through improved resource management and scalability.

The choice of Dask provides the optimal balance of performance, flexibility, and ease of integration for this specific use case, while the modular architecture ensures the framework can evolve to support future requirements.
